# Task - 1
Use a pull up resistor to make a toggle switch to control a LED 
# Task - 2
Get the input from the gas sensor and when the input is more than half of the maximum value(its ok if its approximate) turn on a Fan(DC motor)
Using DC motor is similar to using a led. we can rotate the motor just by digitalWrite(pin,,HIGH)
