# Task - 1
**Deadline-11th july**

Use a pull up resistor to make a toggle switch to control a LED
# Task - 2
**Deadline-11th july**

Get the input from the gas sensor and when the input is more than half of the maximum value(its ok if its approximate) turn on a Fan(DC motor)
Using DC motor is similar to using a led. we can rotate the motor just by digitalWrite(pin,,HIGH)
# Task - 3
**Deadline-11th july**

Control the colour of RGB LED on master by receiving the values for brightness of R,G,B from three slaves . I.e there will be 3 potentiometers on three slaves respectively which will send the R,G,B brightness level to master and master will glow the RGB LED accordingly. Hint (You will be sending data only from 3 slaves to master , Checkout the project 1 that we did today incase you are stuck or dm me if any doubts :)  )
# Task - 4
**Deadline-11th july**

Make a circuit in tinkercad which If on button in IR remote is pressed, then the NeoPixel shows loading sign with color changing colors {from red to blue to green} as it completes a single loop around the NeoPixel ring only.
